Project 2 Instructions:

In this project you will perform the physical design and implementation using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) and proceed with populating the Mom and Pop Johnson Video Store database via Data Manipulation Language (DML) SQL commands. Each of the steps below requires a SPOOL file to be submitted. Be sure your SPOOL file contains your SQL statements along with the Oracle responses and/or displayed results. Do NOT submit your SQL script files. Only submit your output SPOOL files. If you are using iSQL*Plus you must screen snapshots as necessary of your SQL and the results.

Project 2 Details:Create Oracle database tables using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) for each table listed in Project 1. Make sure that entity and referential integrity are enforced by declaring a primary key for each table (these may be composite keys) and declaring all appropriate foreign keys. Your CREATE TABLE statements must show integrity constraints, as appropriate, for NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, REFERENCES, and CHECK constraints. Be sure to save your script used to create these tables as yournameproject2step1.sql. You should test your script to make sure it runs without error. Submit your SPOOL file showing that all SQL in your SQL script file worked properly.Provide two examples of SQL DML (i.e., “INSERT”) commands that fail different table integrity constraints you set up in one of your table. Explain why the statements fail. Be sure to save your script used to as yournameproject2step2.sql.

You can include comments in the SQL script describing why the insert statements failed. Submit your SPOOL file showing that all SQL in your SQL script file worked properly.Populate each of your tables with at least five valid rows of data each and show the SQL you used. Populate other tables in your database, as necessary, to satisfy referential integrity. Be sure to save your script used to create these records as yournameproject2step3.sql. You should test your script to make sure it runs without error. Submit your SPOOL file showing that all SQL in your SQL script file worked properly.

Write SQL to perform the following queries and updates. Be sure to save your script used to create these records as yournameproject2step4.sql. You should test your script to make sure it runs without error:Retrieve all of your customers’ names, account numbers, and addresses (street and zip code only), sorted by account number.

Retrieve all of the videos rented in the last 30 days and sort in chronological rental date order.Produce a list of your distributors and all their information sorted in order by company name.Update a customer name to change their maiden names to married names. You can choose which row to update. Make sure that you use the primary key column in your WHERE clause to affect only a specific row.Delete customers from the database. You can choose which row to delete. Make sure that you use the primary key column in your WHERE clause to affect only a specific row.Submit your SPOOL file(s) showing that all SQL in your SQL script file worked properly. Show the actual SQL statements executed and the results the SQL produced below the code. Do NOT submit your SQL script files. Also, submit all of your .sql files.
